        I was driving home from vacation the past month and the cities <del>inevitable</del> traffic, all ready tired from driving from city to city plus three hours in the border and voila! relief came to me in the form of a <strong>local radio station 105.7 fm</strong> </b>Im sure many of you did listened to a lot of radio when young. Im sure you as I recorded songs on the cassete player trying to cut out the DJ Intros so that we had nothing but music on our mix tape.
        Anyways the radio had their top 5 Songs of all time, Well I have my own and a brief story of why became my top 5.

Never to lose a song again.</small>
